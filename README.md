Code Jetter is a PHP MVC Framework which is handcrafted with love! Some of the features that make a developer life easier are:

- Advanced routing system:
Code Jetter has got an advanced routing system that can handle different scenarios efficiently. For example you are able to have required or optional parameters in the URL.

- Built-in user authentication:
Using the basic built-in user authentication in the framework you do not worry about user management anymore.

- IO management

- Built-in validator to validate inputs efficiently and all in one place:
There is a validator class that simply allows you to validate inputs all in one place instead of writing your own functions. 

- Built-in query maker to create PDO queries and bind the values automatically

- Utility classes to add more juice to default PHP functions

- Multilingual system:
Code Jetter supports Multilingual content by utilizing the Language class and JSON language files.

- Pure PHP template engine which removes the need to learn and use another syntax e.g. Smarty. It is also much faster to use PHP itself instead of using another layer on top of that.
